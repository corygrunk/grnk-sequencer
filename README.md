# grnk-sequencer
A sequencer for Monome Norns with live pads

Very WIP. Requires a Grid and Norns. Crow and Just Friends support.

![basic instructions](https://github.com/corygrunk/grnk-sequencer/blob/b2f1d8740f450d6466bf786b72ac4ee0953545de/grnk-seq-instructions.png)

## Install on Norns
Run this in maiden: `;install https://github.com/corygrunk/grnk-sequencer`

## TODO
- There's no saving of anything, so once you leave the script, you're going to lose your patterns.
- Offsets get wonky when you change their speed. They're off by a step.
- Changing engines will activate/deactivate JF. I need to move this to the parameters page.
- Live recording notes seems to quantize incorrectly by a step.
- I don't think Crow 3/4 works right now.
